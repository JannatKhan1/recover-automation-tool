#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-37436

Description: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's perf subsystem handled certain events. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.

Severity Score: * Critical


Attack Vectors: * Local access

Possible Attacks: * Denial of service (system crash)
* Arbitrary code execution

Impact: * A system crash could lead to data loss or service disruption.
* Arbitrary code execution could allow an attacker to take control of the system.

Root Cause: * The perf subsystem mishandled certain events.

Patch/Remediation: * The Linux kernel has been updated to fix this issue. Users are advised to update their systems to the latest version.

Threat Score Impact: * Very High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-36760

Description: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Severity Score: * 7.5 (Critical)


Attack Vectors: * Local

Possible Attacks: * Denial of service
* Code execution

Impact: * A local attacker could cause a system crash or execute arbitrary code.

Root Cause: * A flaw in the netfilter subsystem's packet validation code

Patch/Remediation: * The Linux kernel has been updated to fix this issue. Users are advised to update their kernels to the latest version.

Threat Score Impact: * Very High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-31813

Description: A vulnerability has been identified in the Linux kernel that could allow an unprivileged local user to gain root privileges. The vulnerability exists in the `net/packet/af_packet.c` file and is caused by an incorrect check of the `PACKET_HOST` flag when creating a packet socket. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted packet socket and then using it to send a packet to the kernel. This could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the system.

Severity Score: * 7.5 (Critical)


Attack Vectors: * Local
* Unauthenticated
* Privilege escalation

Possible Attacks: * A local attacker could create a specially crafted packet socket and then use it to send a packet to the kernel. This could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the system.

Impact: * Gaining root privileges on a system could allow an attacker to perform a wide range of malicious activities, including installing malware, modifying system files, or stealing sensitive data.

Root Cause: * An incorrect check of the `PACKET_HOST` flag when creating a packet socket.

Patch/Remediation: * The Linux kernel has been patched to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to update their kernels to the latest version as soon as possible.

Threat Score Impact: * Very High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-30556

Description: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem handled certain events. A privileged user inside a guest VM could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the host.

Severity Score: * The base security score for this vulnerability is 7.5.


Attack Vectors: * A privileged user inside a guest VM could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the host.

Possible Attacks: * A denial of service attack could be launched against a host running a vulnerable kernel.

Impact: * A denial of service (system crash) could be caused on the host.

Root Cause: * The flaw is due to an error in the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem.

Patch/Remediation: * The affected kernel versions can be patched with the following updates:

Threat Score Impact: * The threat score impact of this vulnerability is High.

Possibility of Threat: * The possibility of threat of this vulnerability is High.

Vulnerability of Asset: * The vulnerability of asset of this vulnerability is High.

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-29404

Description: A vulnerability has been identified in the way that the Linux kernel's TCP stack handles certain packets. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code on the target system.

Severity Score: * The base security score for this vulnerability is 7.5 out of 10.


Attack Vectors: * A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet to a vulnerable system.

Possible Attacks: * A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code on the target system.

Impact: * A denial of service (system crash) or arbitrary code execution could lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data.

Root Cause: * The Linux kernel's TCP stack incorrectly handles certain packets.

Patch/Remediation: * A patch has been released for this vulnerability. Systems running affected versions of the Linux kernel should be updated to the latest version as soon as possible.

Threat Score Impact: * The severity of this vulnerability has a high impact on the overall threat score.

Possibility of Threat: * The likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited is high.

Vulnerability of Asset: * The criticality of the asset that is vulnerable to this vulnerability is high.
